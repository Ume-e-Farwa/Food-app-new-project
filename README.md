# Food-app-new-project
This image shows a mobile application mockup for "Foodgo," a food ordering app. The splash screen (left) features a gradient background with the app's logo and an image of a burger, creating an inviting entry point. The main ordering screen (center) allows users to browse food categories and items with images, ratings, and a favorite icon. Users can search for specific items using the search bar and filter results by categories such as "All," "Combos," and "Slider." The profile screen (right) lets users manage their personal information, including name, email, delivery address, and password. Users can also access payment details, order history, and have the options to edit their profile or log out. The design employs a consistent color scheme of red, white, and black for a clean, user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to order their favorite food and manage their accounts efficiently.
